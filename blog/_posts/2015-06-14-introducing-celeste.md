What does it mean to â€˜improve our productâ€™. Companies normally define a set of key performance indicators (KPIs), which everyone (product and engineering) agree that if these numbers are rising, things are going well ðŸŽ‰ . For B2C mobile apps, this might be subscriptions. As long as more people are paying, this means more money for the company. 

These KPIs become the data driven driver of the product. If these numbers are decreasing, we need to rethink our plan and strategy, if they are increasing, we stick with the plan.
