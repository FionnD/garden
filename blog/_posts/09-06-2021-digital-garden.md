I always fantasize about the idea of having a blog; it seems like a 'thing' to have. So a couple of times, I'd go to the effort of setting one up, writing some posts on some topic but never really following through for long. 

The epiphany happened when I realized that I was comparing blog posts to academic papers. As a result, anything I wrote had to a well-researched, informative, and definitive summary of a topic. Which understandably made it hard ever to find the time to write.. 

I came across the concept of digital gardens recently. 

"While not everybody has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.

A garden is usually a place where things grow.

Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy, or a garden can be a source of food and substance." https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden

This idea that I could keep a place where my thoughts grow, and I don't have to declare any level of research was very appealing publically. 

It is especially relevant for a career in product management. So much of PMing is soft skills, and opinions and approaches to work are essential. Having a place where I can keep those opinions and send them to colleagues, friends, etc. should be valuable. 

While looking into other's digital gardens, there were some things I liked, and some I didn't. Some DG use recursive or node linking between entities. I don't really get this, so I didn't dive much into that. 

[Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) has some good thoughts on why paginated posted sorted chronologically fuckin' sucks. This is why my home page follows a file structure. I might translate it into a more wiki approach like [tomcritchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) someday. 

For anyone interested in DG, I suggest reading the following two posts:
