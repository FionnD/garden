Nothing I write here is as valuable as reading Avery Pennarun incredibly long read on story points [link](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213#slide5). If you have, skip my shit and read this. 

I remember attending a sprint refinement and watching as the pm assigned 100 story points to a ticket. This was happening because the management team (all engineers by the way!) were using story points to assess engineer performance. So obvious we ended up in story point inflation land. 

When I ended up taking over the team as PM, I did away with story points. I honestly didn't see the need for them. 

The purpose of story points is to estimate the size of a piece of work roughly, so you plan capacity. This works under the assumptions: 
You want to plan capacity 
Your "piece of work" is generally well defined, and the team is experienced enough to know how to 'roughly' solve them. 
Your team size isn't changing. 

I use the word roughly a lot because we can't tell the future. We, as humans, are pretty good at 'roughly' estimating something. We are very good at telling you that you could probably fit two Englands into Germany (it's actually closer to [1.5](https://www.mylifeelsewhere.com/country-size-comparison/germany/united-kingdom)). We are terrible at telling you the actual distance between London and Glasgow to the exact mile. 

Therefore, we are pretty good at saying if a feature would take twice or three times as long as the feature we implemented last week. This is where story points become super valuable.
